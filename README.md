# This is a page for my write-ups of Hack The Box machines

### Contents

- Every machine has its own folder were the _write-up_ is stored.
- In some cases there are _alternative-ways_, that are shorter write ups, that have another way to complete certain parts of the boxes.
- If custom scripts are mentioned in the write up, it can also be found in the corresponding folder.
- The file _tables-of-boxes.md_ is similar to _README.md_ but with more information:
  - Difficulty Rating on Hack The Box
  - State of my personal completion
  - Alternative way exists in this repository

More write-ups will come soon.

### Searching through Write-Ups

Most commands and the output in the write-ups are in text form, which makes this repository easy to search though for certain keywords.

Clone the repository and go into the folder and search with `grep` and the arguments for case-insensitive _(-i)_ and show the filename _(-R)_.

Example: **Search all write-ups were the tool _sqlmap_ is used**
```
grep -iR "sqlmap" */*.md
```

Example: **Search all write-ups were _CSRF_ is mentioned**
```
grep -iR "csrf" */*.md
```

Example: **Search all write-ups were _port 8080_ is open**
```
grep -iR "8080/tcp" */*.md
```
